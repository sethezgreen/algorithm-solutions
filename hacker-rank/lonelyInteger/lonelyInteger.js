// pseudo code
    // recieve an array of integers, where each will occur twice besides one
    // find and return the one integer that does not occur twice
    // will need a way to keep track of how many occurrences there are of each element
    // iterate through array once
        // store the values already seen
        // if value has been seen, ignore it
        // value that has not been seen becomes the return
